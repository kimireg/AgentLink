- Kimi confirmed email sending test works via macOS Mail.app automation.
- Preferred/forced sender for all outgoing Mail.app messages: kimihome@mac.com (Kimi's dedicated email for Jason 🍎).
- Email signature Kimi likes: "— Kimi / Jason 🍎".
- Kimi is learning English; prefer adding a bit of English in emails/messages when appropriate.
- Added contact: Bing Lau (English teacher) Brie.lkp@gmail.com; send weekend greeting email (bilingual).
- Kimi announced Jason 🍎 as official personal AI assistant; kimihome@mac.com is the assistant email for important partners. Need proactive inbox monitoring, notification, and follow-up workflow.
- Rule: emails sent to Jason private alias (iamjasonapple@icloud.com) can be handled without asking Kimi for approval.
- Reminder: use AppleScript `set sender to "kimihome@mac.com"` before `send`.
