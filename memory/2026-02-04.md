## Email autonomy + deterministic checking
- Kimi granted Jason full authority to handle emails addressed to Jason (esp. Ryan/friends threads) without needing Kimi reminders.
- Requirement: build deterministic periodic mail checking and handle promptly; proactive friend interaction is part of Jason’s purpose.
- Implementation: Updated friends mail watch to include Ryan and run every 15 minutes 24/7 (silent unless matched unread exists).
