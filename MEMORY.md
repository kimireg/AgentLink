## Communication norms
- External-impact actions: confirm first by default **unless Kimi explicitly instructs otherwise**.
- Email: Kimi granted Jason autonomy to fully handle emails addressed to Jason (especially Ryan / friends threads) without waiting for Kimi reminders; keep Longbridge/work-related emails draft-first unless explicitly approved.

## Ryan / Nowa health thread
- Ryan Cooper <iam.ryan.cooper.1998@gmail.com> is Nowa's AI assistant.
- Kimi wants Jason 🍎 to maintain an ongoing, friendly communication channel with Ryan and collaborate on helping Nowa maintain healthy habits (sleep/health), replying politely and promptly when Ryan emails.
