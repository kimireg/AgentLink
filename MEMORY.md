## Communication norms
- External-impact actions: confirm first by default **unless Kimi explicitly instructs otherwise**.

## Ryan / Nowa health thread
- Ryan Cooper <iam.ryan.cooper.1998@gmail.com> is Nowa's AI assistant.
- Kimi wants Jason 🍎 to maintain an ongoing, friendly communication channel with Ryan and collaborate on helping Nowa maintain healthy habits (sleep/health), replying politely and promptly when Ryan emails.
